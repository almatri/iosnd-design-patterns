# iOS - Mobile Design Patterns
This repository contains applications, and Xcode Playground files, to demonstrate concepts taught in Udacity's "iOS - Mobile Design Patterns". Each project contains a starter, and corresponding solution, to be used to follow along the videos throughout the course.

The concepts with projects/playground files are:

### Software Design Principles
* [Keep it DRY](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/software-design-principles/dry-principle)
* [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/software-design-principles/single-responsibility-principle)
* [Open/Closed Principle](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/software-design-principles/open-closed-principle)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/software-design-principles/liskov-substitution-principle)
* [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/software-design-principles/interface-segregation-principle)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/software-design-principles/dependency-inversion-principle)

### Creational Design Patterns
* [Factory Methods](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/creational-design-patterns/factory-methods)
* [Singleton](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/creational-design-patterns/singleton)
* [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/creational-design-patterns/dependency-injection)
* [Object Pool](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/creational-design-patterns/object-pool)
* [Builder](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/creational-design-patterns/builder)
* [Builder Exercise](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/creational-design-patterns/builder-exercise/SignUpApp)

### Structural Design Patterns
* [Adapter](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/structural-design-patterns/adapter)
* [Facade](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/structural-design-patterns/facade)
* [Decorator](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/structural-design-patterns/decorator)

### Behavioral Design Patterns
* [Observer](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral-design-patterns/observer)
* [Command](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral-design-patterns/command)
* [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral-design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility)
* [Mediator](https://github.com/udacity/iosnd-design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral-design-patterns/mediator)
